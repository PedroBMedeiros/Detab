Special Instructions:
	In order to run the program, all that is needed is to run file resulting from compilation.

	If no input file is given by using the "< exampleFile.txt" functionality when running the program, the terminal will await typed input from user.
	Once satisfied with the input, click the enter key to send the input in to the program.

	Assuming an input file was given (using "< InputFile.txt") the program will spit out the output in "stdout".
